# Regression Analysis - Temperature Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of **Linear Regression** for predicting **month-wise temperature** based on the provided dataset. The project demonstrates the use of regression techniques to analyze temperature data and evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict temperature variations month-wise using a **Linear Regression** model. The project includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the dataset for regression analysis.
- **Linear Regression**: Applying a linear regression model to predict monthly temperature.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model’s performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **R-squared** metrics.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the regression model to understand the relationship between the input (month) and output (temperature).

## 🛠 Features

- **Linear Regression Model**: The core model used to predict temperature based on the month.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R-Squared are calculated to assess model accuracy.
- **Visualization**: A graph displaying the regression line and observed data points.

## 📁 File Structure

- **`temperature_data.csv`**: The dataset containing temperature data (month-wise).
- **`regression_analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of linear regression, performance evaluation, and visualization.

## 🛑 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning and regression models.


## 📈 Regression Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual temperatures.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual temperatures.
- **R-Squared**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable (month).

## 📉 Visualization

The project also includes a plot of the linear regression model, showing the temperature predictions alongside the actual data points. This helps in understanding the relationship between the month (input) and temperature (output).
